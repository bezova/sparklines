## Sparklines in Pandas

Sparklines are small unlabeled plots, used to visually convey an idea in a small space.  This script creates sparklines in a Pandas DataFrame which can then be displayed inline in a Jupyter Notebook or output to an HTML file.  It does not annotate the figure, other columns of the DataFrame can be used to convey details about the sparklines.
